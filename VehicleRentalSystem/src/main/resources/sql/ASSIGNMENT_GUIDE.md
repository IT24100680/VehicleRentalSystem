## Database Schema Changes Made

### New Tables Added (EER Requirements)
1. **VehicleType** - Categorizes vehicles with base rates

6. **Bike** - Vehicle specialization (ISA relationship)
7. **Driver** - Driver entity for booking assignments
8. **BookingAudit** - Audit trail for booking changes

### Modified Tables

2. **Vehicles** - Added reg_no, daily_rate, vehicle_type_id
3. **Bookings** - Added driver_id, total_cost field
4. **Payments** - Added method, transaction_ref fields
5. **Feedback** - Added rating, comment, date fields
6. **Tickets** - Added subject, description, status, cost fields

## File Structure

```
src/main/resources/sql/
├── updated_create_tables.sql    # Complete DDL with all tables
├── updated_sample_data.sql      # Sample data (5+ records per table)
├── assignment_queries.sql       # 5+ SQL queries for Part D
├── stored_procedures.sql        # Stored procedures for Part E
├── triggers.sql                 # Triggers for Part F
└── ASSIGNMENT_GUIDE.md          # This documentation file
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Backup Current Database
```sql
-- Backup your current database before making changes
BACKUP DATABASE VehicleRentalDB TO DISK = 'C:\backup\VehicleRentalDB_backup.bak';
```

### Step 2: Run Updated Schema
```sql
-- Execute the updated schema
-- This will create all new tables and modify existing ones
-- Run: updated_create_tables.sql
```

### Step 3: Insert Sample Data
```sql
-- Insert sample data for all tables
-- Run: updated_sample_data.sql
```

### Step 4: Test Queries
```sql
-- Test the assignment queries
-- Run: assignment_queries.sql
```

### Step 5: Test Stored Procedures
```sql
-- Test stored procedures
-- Run: stored_procedures.sql
```

### Step 6: Test Triggers
```sql
-- Test triggers
-- Run: triggers.sql
```

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. EER Diagram Compliance
- **ISA Relationships**: Vehicle → Car/Van/Bike specialization
- **Multivalued Attributes**: User emails and phones in separate tables
- **Composite Attributes**: Address broken into street, city, postal_code
- **All Required Entities**: User, Vehicle, Booking, Payment, Feedback, Ticket, Driver, VehicleType

### 2. Data Integrity
- **Primary Keys**: All tables have proper PKs
- **Foreign Keys**: All relationships properly defined
- **Constraints**: CHECK constraints for status fields, ratings, etc.
- **Triggers**: Automatic validation and status updates

### 3. Business Logic
- **Automatic Vehicle Status Updates**: When bookings are approved/completed
- **Driver Rating Calculation**: Based on feedback
- **Booking Cost Calculation**: With discount support
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of booking changes

### 4. Performance Optimization
- **Indexes**: On frequently queried columns
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized for common operations
- **Proper Data Types**: Appropriate sizes for all fields

## Web Application Compatibility

### Maintained Compatibility
- All existing table names preserved where possible
- Existing column names maintained for core functionality
- Foreign key relationships preserved
- Data types compatible with existing Java models

### New Features Available
- Driver assignment to bookings
- Vehicle type categorization
- Multiple contact methods per user
- Enhanced feedback system
- Comprehensive audit trail

## Testing and Verification

### 1. Verify Sample Data
```sql
-- Check all tables have at least 5 records
SELECT 'Users' AS TableName, COUNT(*) AS RecordCount FROM Users
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Vehicles', COUNT(*) FROM Vehicles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Bookings', COUNT(*) FROM Bookings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Payments', COUNT(*) FROM Payments
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Feedback', COUNT(*) FROM Feedback
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Tickets', COUNT(*) FROM Tickets
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Driver', COUNT(*) FROM Driver
UNION ALL
SELECT 'VehicleType', COUNT(*) FROM VehicleType;
```

### 2. Test Stored Procedures
```sql
-- Test booking cost calculation
DECLARE @Cost DECIMAL(10,2), @Days INT, @Rate DECIMAL(10,2);
EXEC CalculateBookingCost 1, '2024-03-15', '2024-03-18', 10.0, @Cost OUTPUT, @Days OUTPUT, @Rate OUTPUT;
SELECT @Cost AS TotalCost, @Days AS RentalDays, @Rate AS DailyRate;
```

### 3. Test Triggers
```sql
-- Test vehicle status update trigger
INSERT INTO Bookings (user_id, vehicle_id, driver_id, start_date, end_date, pickup_location, dropoff_location, total_cost, status)
VALUES (2, 1, 1, '2024-04-01', '2024-04-03', 'Test Location', 'Test Location', 150.00, 'Approved');

-- Check if vehicle status was updated
SELECT vehicle_id, reg_no, status FROM Vehicles WHERE vehicle_id = 1;
```

## Notes for Web Application

### No Changes Required
Your existing web application should continue to work without modifications because:
1. Core table structures are preserved
2. Existing column names maintained
3. Foreign key relationships preserved
4. Data types compatible

### Optional Enhancements
You can optionally enhance your web application to use new features:
1. Driver assignment in booking forms
2. Vehicle type filtering
3. Multiple contact methods for users
4. Enhanced feedback system
5. Audit trail viewing

## Conclusion
